Your wedding is full of irreplaceable memories. The atmosphere is captivating, and you are the star. My job is to freeze in time the moments that take your breath away, so the magic can be cherished for generations.

When I was asked to describe my wedding photography in just 3 words that took a lot of thinking. How can I describe something so personal, passionate and diverse in just 3 words. After thinking through what I always work with my couples to capture I knew what my 3 words were, Modern, Fun and Timeless. Let me explain.

Modern because my overall photography style is modern. Its got a photo-journalistic flair to it with unique angles and perspectives as well as getting the trendy Pinterest style shots. Fun because I always make sure to get some shots that are off the wall and fun that make everyone laugh and will make them laugh for generations when they see the photos. This is such a crucial part of the day, adding in that aspect of fun. Its also what rounds out the wedding album. When your grandchildren look at your wedding album they will see that grandma and grandpa were wild and fun! Timeless because with all of the modern flair and the fun shots of the season I want my couples to look back at their photos and have shots that are always in style. The traditional shots of everyone looking at the camera that years down the road would be missed if they weren't captured. The shots that make the wedding album and memories truly timeless.
